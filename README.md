## Introduction

VbrArt is an artistic installation created by David Badiane, Marco Donzelli and Miriam Papagno. It brings together several worlds linked to the ondulatory world of acoustics. The aim of this installation is to enhance the curiosity related to Music and its 'physicality' everywhere around us.

## General structure

The user interaction happens through Leap Motion and Arduino 1. He can choose between four different scenarios, each of which represent an acoustic feature. Processing, Supercollider and Python frameworks are used to develop this project.
The graphic part is managed by Processing, you can find any part of the code related to graphics in the folder 'Processing'.
Supercollider handles the music framework of the entire project.
In a part of the project, also Python is used, to develop a Markov model to choose between chords, introducing more randomicity in the project in order to give a more natural footprint.
