## Introduction

VbrArt is an artistic installation created by David Badiane, Marco Donzelli and Miriam Papagno. It brings together several worlds linked to the ondulatory world of acoustics. The aim of this installation is to enhance the curiosity related to Music and its 'physicality' everywhere around us.

## General structure

The user interaction happens through Leap Motion and Arduino 1. He can choose between four different scenarios, each of which represent an acoustic feature. Processing, Supercollider and Python frameworks are used to develop this project.
The graphic part is managed by Processing, you can find any part of the code related to graphics in the folder 'Processing'.
Supercollider handles the music framework of the entire project.
In a part of the project, also Python is used, to develop a Markov model to choose between chords, introducing more randomicity in the project in order to give a more natural footprint.

## Inside the scene
The four scenerios consist of four different backgrounds to choose through the electric circuit that models the arduino setup. If an Arduino 1 is not available, the choice ca be made through computer keyboard. In every background a physic representation of acoustic is depicted: in the first background clahdni pattern simulation on a plate is implemented; the second background consists of the simulation of a water drop; the third background represents an acoustic string instrument and the fourth background is related to the FFT of a sound, an important feature of the sound signal.
The user can play with one background at a time, giving vent to his creativity.
Interaction happens through Leap Motion tracking or MousePositions tracking.

Any further information can be found in the 'Presentation' power point.

Enjoy your play!
